## Introduction
This report has been written as a part of a project for the Data Science: Capstone HarvardX - PH125.9x course. The objective of the project is to analyse the Movie lens data set to create a recommendation system based on the previous ratings by viewers. The movie lens data set is a huge data set with 9000055 observations of 6 variables, the data set covers 10677 unique movies, their ratings and classification by genre. Ratings by 69878 unique viewers are logged. A lot of the analysis around this data set was popularized by the Netflix prize, which was a challenge to build a better movie recommendation engine for netflix.

The MovieLens Data set is collected by GroupLens Research and can be found on the MovieLens web site (<http://movielens.org>).

Building upon this, my analysis looks at first the exploratory analysis of the data, identifying the trends in the data set, we then look at what are the potential biases and create models to address the biases, based on which Root mean squared error is calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of each model. At the outset, (given the data provided), we can look at the user wise effect (how the data varies user to user), the time effect (how ratings have evolved over the years), we can look at the genre effect ( how the data varies by genre), and the movie effect itsel (some movies are popular and hence have more ratings). The models would be evolved around these factors.
